Pair programming consists of two programmers with a single workstation (one display, keyboard, and mouse for the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called a "driver", and the other, who is also actively involved in programming but with a focus on code management is called a "navigator"; Programmers are expected to change roles from time to time.

The names of several celebrities are used when discussing the origin of couple programming; There are anecdotes of John Von Neummann, Fred Brooks, Jerry Weinberg, Richard Gabriel, and Edsger Dijkstra using this practice. However, verifiable sources suggest that pair programming, in its modern form, has existed before the agile movement:

- 1992: "Dynamic Duo" is a term coined by Larry Constantine when reporting a visit to Whitesmiths Inc., a compiler provider started by P.J. Plauger, one of the C implementers: "There were two programmers on each terminal! Of course, only one programmer was typing code on the keyboard, but the others were looking over their shoulders." Whitesmiths existed from 1978 to 1988.

- 1993: "The benefits of collaboration for student programmers" by Wilson et al. is an empirical study that indicates the benefits of pair programming.

- 1995: A description is given of the pattern "Developing in Pairs", in the form of Alexandrian patterns and in the chapter "A Generative Development-Process Pattern Language" of Jim Copliens' first pattern book "Pattern Languages ​​of Program Design ".

- 1998: in "Chrysler goes to Extremes", the first article on extreme programming, programming in pairs is presented as one of the main practices of the C3 team; it is later described as one of the original twelve XP practices.

- 2000: Driver and navigator roles are introduced to help explain Pair programming; the oldest reference is in a mail chain.

- 2002: "Pair Programming Illuminated", by Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler, is the first book focused exclusively on this practice and discusses its theory, practice and various studies done up to that date.

- 2005: James Coplien publishes Two Heads are Better Than One which provides a summary of the history of pair programming dating back to the mid-1980's if not earlier.
